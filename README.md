# bamazon

This Bamazon website is a project for the Georgia Tech coding Bootcamp. Its intent is to a simple mimic of functionality available on a purchasing site such as Amazon. 

To get started with the project, navigate to the primary page. From there, select the number of items you would like to add to your cart, and click 'Add to Cart'. Once you checkout, the number of selected items will be deducted from the inventory of that item.
